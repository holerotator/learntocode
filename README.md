Hello im an appalachian dirt farmer who was let out of debtors prison not long ago.

This repository has a text file called 'learning_progress.txt' where i take notes about the https://www.codecademy.com/ lessons.

I pay for the tuition by selling cool rocks at the swap meet

Future projects will go in here in a system yet to be determined.
